# MESTO_REACT_AUTH
### My final version of MESTO project created during Ya.Practicum course "WEB developer"
##### The goal of this project was to implement user support (registration and authorization) in the project [MESTO_REACT](https://github.com/PolinaLashchanka/mesto-react).
##### This is a single page application, where you can register and create your own personal account. You can add and delete your photos, and also view and rate photos of other users.
##### When you click the button next to the user name, a form for editing information about the user will open.
#### Technological stack
